This project dispalys the basic use of Bootstrap and how that can make coding in Html and CSS much more easier.

To get started with this project, I first the downloaded Bootstrap files from their website and as I went on I began to use their intergrated them into my HTML and CSS.

For this project I collaborated with the instructors from the Visiola Foundation Bootcamp and its through their guidance that I was able to finalise it.

Feel free to fork it, redesign it and recreate it into your own website.
